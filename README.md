# indecisive-backend

My latest project I'm currently building using PostgreSQL and Node.JS to manage the backend.

The app is for those who can't decide what to cook, you put in minimal search terms and the app suggests up to three dishes for you to make.

To be built next: Login and Admin privelages for managing the DB from the frontend including deleting dishes, access to full CRUD of all dishes (with pagination) from admin page.
